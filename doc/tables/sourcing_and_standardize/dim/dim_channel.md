## ðŸ“œ Table: Dim_Channel

This dimension defines the available banking channels such as online, ATM, branch, or mobile. It is used to enrich transactions, detect channel-specific anomalies, and support channel-based reporting and segmentation.

- **Type**: Dimension  
- **CDC Type**: `1.1`  
- **Writer Type**: `scd1`  
- **Primary Key**: `Channel_Code` (from source)  
- **Partitioned By**: `ds_partition_date` (string)  
- **Snapshot Strategy**: Not applicable â€“ overwrite-only (SCD1)
