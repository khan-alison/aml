## ðŸ“œ Table: Fact_Customer_Risk_Score

This fact table stores the daily computed risk score of each customer based on multiple AML signals. It supports alert generation, profiling, model training, and ongoing monitoring of behavioral and exposure-based risk.

- **Type**: Fact  
- **CDC Type**: `1.3`  
- **Writer Type**: `scd4a`  
- **Primary Key**: `Customer_ID + Score_Date` (from source)  
- **Partitioned By**: `ds_partition_date` (string, in `_Hist` table only)  
- **Snapshot Strategy**: SCD4a â€“ current risk score in main table, full scoring history in `_Hist`
