## ðŸ“œ Table: Fact_Risk_Score

This table stores risk scores calculated for each customer on a specific day. It includes scoring details, band categorization, contributing rules, and whether the score was overridden. Used in AML decisioning, segmentation, and model explainability.

- **Type**: Fact  
- **CDC Type**: `1.3`  
- **Writer Type**: `factUpsert`  
- **Primary Key**: Composite key â€“ `(Customer_ID, Score_Date)`  
- **Partitioned By**: `ds_partition_date`  
- **Description**: Contains customer-level risk scores with driving factor explanations. Supports both model-based and rule-based risk assessments.
