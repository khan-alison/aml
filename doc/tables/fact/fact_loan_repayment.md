## ðŸ“œ Table: Fact_Loan_Repayment

This table is used to track detailed daily loan repayment activity for each loan held by a customer. It captures the total repayment amount made on a given day, how that amount is split into interest and principal, the repayment method used (e.g., auto-debit, manual transfer), and the remaining balance after the repayment. This enables financial institutions to monitor loan performance, assess payment behavior, and support delinquency analysis.

- **Type**: Fact  
- **CDC Type**: `1.3`  
- **Writer Type**: `factUpsert`  
- **Primary Key**: Composite key â€“ `(Loan_ID, Repayment_Date)`  
- **Partitioned By**: `ds_partition_date`  
- **Description**: Captures daily loan repayment activities by customers, including amount, breakdown of principal and interest, and remaining balance. Each record reflects the latest status of a loan repayment on a given day.
