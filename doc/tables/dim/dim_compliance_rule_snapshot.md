## ðŸ“œ Table: Dim_Compliance_Rule_Snapshot

This dimension captures the full state of compliance detection rules in effect on any given day. Using `SCD4a`, it maintains the latest version in the main table and daily full snapshots in the history table. Designed to support model explainability, audit trail, and rollback validation.

- **Type**: Dimension  
- **CDC Type**: `1.3` (with `created_at`, `updated_at` at source)  
- **Writer Type**: `scd4a`  
- **Primary Key**: `Rule_ID`  
- **Partitioned By**: `ds_partition_date` (history table)
